# Input Validation Error in DApp Reward Calculation

This repository demonstrates a common error in decentralized applications (DApps): insufficient input validation.  The `calculateReward` function lacks robust error handling for negative input values, potentially leading to unexpected application behavior or security vulnerabilities.  The solution demonstrates how to implement proper input validation and handle negative input gracefully.
